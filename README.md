I'm @antony-git, a third-year at the University of Chicago majoring in molecular engineering (bioengineering track) and minoring in computer science.
I'm interested in the crossover between these two disciplines, particularly in the area of machine learning.
I do molecular dynamics and density functional theory research, and am interested in tech projects in general.
