I'm @antony-git, a University of Chicago molecular engineering (bioengineering track) major and computer science minor.
I'm interested in the crossover between these two disciplines in areas like bioinformatics and computational biology.
I have experience in molecular dynamics and density functional theory research, and am generally interested in computational science and data science projects.
